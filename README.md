# Workflow: High-level wrapper around CloudKeeper

Workflow-service component that wraps [CloudKeeper](https://github.com/lifecodehealth/cloudkeeper) in order to provide a
higher-level library. For instance, configuration happens using the
[Typesafe Config library](https://github.com/typesafehub/config), and all low-level CloudKeeper components are
automatically wired together according to this configuration.
